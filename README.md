# habits

During a period of post-breakup growth I read several books on self-improvement, productivity and meditation. Two systems stood out to me in particular - the Eisenhower Matrix / Quadrant System and a "Don't Break the Chain" type habit calendar.

Frustrated with existing web-based solutions I began to build my own that would allow custom time schedules for chains.  For instance, you must meditate & plan your day every morning, but you only need to run 4 times a week, and the time is unimportant.  (Skipping a day does not result in a broken chain)

The UI is ugly because it was a prototype.  I use a WorkFlowy based system for productivity.

Testing took place using a large wall-calendar using markers.  The patterns of those marks are replicated in the code.

When I switched to my application, *I felt less incentivised*.

Development stopped abruptly.

I bought another wall calendar.
